# Python-HTML-Parser
This is a generic HTML parsing script template for recursively searching through bulk or individual HTML files. The template provides two arguments, one for specifying the file path and the other for specifying recursive search. You add your own method in this script to manipulate the files found or do whatever you so desire. I have had to resuse this template multiple times so I thought it may be useful for others :)

Requires Beautiful Soup and Python3.*
